		<h1>Features</h1>
		Our project aims to develop a tool for financial risk management.
		More precisely, it provides three different methods to compute the Value-at-Risk, a measure of the risk of loss on portfolio of financial assets.
		Our software assists the user through his decision-making process, from the creation of portfolio to the comparison of the three methods:
		<ol>
			<li>Historic method: the simplest method</li>
			<li>GARCH modelisation: based on a volatility and returns model</li>
			<li>Riskmetrics method: heuristic-based method using a particular case of the GARCH modelisation</li>
		</ol>
		In its first stage, our software will allow the user to produce several reports as PDF or DOCX documents.<br/>

		Currently, it is the only open-source product on the market to provide such services.
		The software is licenced under the LGPL 3.<br/>
		<br/>

		<h1>How does it work?</h1>
		Our software core is entirely written in C++.
		However, it uses several other languages and frameworks for certain features.<br/>

		It relies on <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a>, which is a free software environnement for statistical computing.
		R is used for several algorithms such as the GARCH estimation and the Riskmetric algorithm.<br/>

		Our graphical user interface uses the <a href="http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.0/qtwidgets/qtwidgets-index.html">Qt widget toolkit</a>.
		It also creates the charts which are then included in the reports.<br/>

		To generate the reports, we developed a light Java command-line tool.
		It uses the open-source API <a href="https://code.google.com/p/xdocreport/">xdocreport</a> and receives the values to include in the report as JSON on the standard input.<br/>
		<br/>

		<h1>Continuous integration</h1>
		Our projet is hosted on <a href="http://github.com/pchaigno/ProjetVaR">GitHub</a>.
		Sources and executables can be downloaded there.<br/>

		We used Open-source software development methods throughout the project.
		All new features or improvements are developped on new branches and then merged into the project using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pull_request">Pull Requests</a>.
		The branch is entirely reviewed by another contributor before merging.
		This method allows us to produce a far better quality software.<br/>
