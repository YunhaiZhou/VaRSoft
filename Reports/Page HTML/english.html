		<h1>Features</h1>
		Our project aims to develop a tool for financial risk management.
		More precisely, it provides three different methods to compute the Value-at-Risk, a measure of the risk of loss on portfolio of financial assets.
		Our software assists the user through his decision-making process, from the creation of portfolio to the comparison of the three methods:
		<ol>
			<li>Historic method</li>
			<li>GARCH modelisation</li>
			<li>Riskmetrics method</li>
		</ol>
		In its first stage, our software will allow the user to produce several reports as PDF or DOCX documents.<br/>

		Currently, it is the only open-source product on the market to provide such services.
		The software is licenced under the LGPL 3.<br/>
		<br/>

		<h1>How does it work?</h1>
		Our software core is entirely written in C++.
		However, it uses several other languages and frameworks for certain features.<br/>

		It relies on the free software environnement for statistical computing, R.
		It is used for several algorithm such as the GARCH estimation and the Riskmetric algorithm.<br/>

		Our graphical user interface uses the Qt widget toolkit.
		The latter also creates the charts which are then included in the reports.<br/>

		To generate the reports, we developed a light Java command-line tool.
		It uses the open-source API xdocreport and receives the values to include in the report as JSON on the standard input.<br/>
